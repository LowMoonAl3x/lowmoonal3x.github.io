# lowmoonal3x.github.io
This is the repository used to host the LowMoon website!
The page exists as an interesting addition to my online presence and nothing more; it doesn't replace my social media or the stores I use to sell games.
And besides, I probably won't even update it that often.
Do what you want with this, I don't really care that much :)



Seeing as I don't know HTML and I'm afraid to learn that language created by the devil himself (All hail Python and GDScript!), this one uses a layout from Itinerae.

Please support her!
(She's from Finland, I hope she doesn't hate PK D:)
