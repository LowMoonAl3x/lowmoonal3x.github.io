# LowMoon's Website! (lowmoonal3x.github.io)
This is the repository used to host the LowMoon website!  
  
The page exists as an interesting addition to my online presence and nothing more.  
It doesn't replace my social media or the stores I use to sell games.  
  
And besides, I probably won't even update it that often.  
Do what you want with this, I don't really care that much :)

Seeing as I don't know HTML and I'm afraid to learn that language created by the devil himself, this one uses a layout from **Itinerae!**  

(All hail Python and GDScript!. These are the languages ​​I recommend, even if you're still a beginner.)  
  
(I'm telling you this myself as a beginner.)
